# XorbisEscape

### XorbisEscape is an online puzzle website created solely by GPTs !! 
I had never engaged in website programming before and possessed no knowledge of it. However, for our year-end party event, I was inspired to create an entertaining online game for my company colleagues. To achieve this, I developed my own GPT models and used Flask to construct a website. 
- GPTs : WebMaker - will be released on gpt online store soon
  - Including database, code, illustration (everything made by GPTs)
- Url : **http://34.22.77.12:5000** (I uploaded it using **GCP**(Google Cloud Platform), but it will be deleted once my trial period expires.)
